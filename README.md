This unique,  new app gives the possibility to tourists  for connecting with local people of the places they are visiting on a one to one basis, without payment.

Both sides gain from the experience. 

The local person has the opportunity to show off his home town, bringing the visitor to small, off the beaten track places he knows about,  that are not written about online,   in the " 10 best things to see ".  The tourist gets to know on a personal level a different culture and society through his conversations and walking with the local person.
Friendly chatting and walking together provide a memorable and individual experience in the world of tourism. It promotes better understanding of a different culture and society that large,  guided tours cannot provide.
